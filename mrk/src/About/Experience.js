        I've been teaching for over 25 years. Except for the year I taught at
        San Pasqual Valley Elementary School, all my teaching has been at the
        Middle School level.

        Have taught in a variety of places, mostly in Phoenix, AZ, but also
        Kissimmee, Florida (right next door to Disney World). I even have two
        years of teaching online.
